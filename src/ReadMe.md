# Project Name
LINKY Online Store

## Overview
-----------

The project is an online store where buyers can login and browse for the goods they are loking for. You can sign up as an admin or a buyer. The admin has more roles such as creating posts, deleting posts, editing current posts and viewing a list of current users. The buyers as of right now only view the items but in future i am looking forward to adding more features such as adding to cart,making orders and integrating payment options as well as tracking their orders. 

## Features
